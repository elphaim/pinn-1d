# pinn-1d

This repo contains the code used to explore various PINN optimization techniques. It allows work on some usual 1d equations (heat, advection, Burgers). The code was generalized from the elphaim/pinn-heat-1d repo by elphaim and Claude Code, as an experiment into the abilities of Claude Code.
